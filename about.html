                    Hello, my name is Clyde Ritchie and welcome to my story. I was born and raised in a small town in
                    the
                    nothern part of Virigina, about an hour and half out side of <br>
                    Washington DC. I went to school here all the way up until college. As a young kid and into my teens
                    I
                    spent all my free time playing different sports throughout the year. <br>
                    From basketball all the way to cross crountry, I felt like I was always at a school sporting event
                    in my
                    school years. As I came became older and got to the age of a college student I enrolled for <br>
                    at the first college I attened which was a small school in southern Virigina called Southern
                    Virigina
                    University. During this time I began my studies of computer science and also <br>
                    played for the schools basketball team. After one year going here I had to transfer to my local
                    community college right outside my hometown. I attened this school for only two semesters <br>
                    before I moved down to the state of North Carolina. I lived in NC for a few years as I tried to
                    figure
                    out life. During this time I held many different retail jobs <br>
                    ranging from working in a deli to a hardware store. After living there for three years I moved to
                    Tacoma
                    Washington, which is where I am currently living and enjoying life.

            <div>
                <p>
                   I started working as a young aduilt and have done many different jobs throughout my carrer. I started out in retail working at Staples. <br>
                   I stuck with retail for the most part when I was going to school and some time after that too.

            <h2>Intrest and Hobbies</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    One of my hobbies that I enjoy doing is taking film photos on my medium format camera from the
                    1970's. I
                    enjoy taking it out on hikes with me and capturing new places I have never been before or places I
                    can
                    seem to never <br>
                    get enough of. I also enjoy spending time going on hikes or walks with my dog Dale. If I am not
                    doing
                    any of these things you can find me at one of the many local HC shows going on in the aera or
                    sometimes
                    in different states/countries. <br>
